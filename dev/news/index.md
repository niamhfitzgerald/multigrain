# Changelog

## multigrain (development version)

## multigrain 0.3.0

### New functionality

- [`graph_optimal_get_control()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/graph_optimal_get_control.md)
  can be used to extract the optimisation settings (i.e. the
  `multigrain_control` object) from the optimised graph.
- [`graph_optimise()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/graph_optimise.md)
  (named changed - see “Changes” below) now accepts a `num_threads`
  argument for parallel execution of the shortcut algorithm. This
  replaces the previous `control_parallel()` workflow. Default is `1L`
  (serial).
- Users can supply names to
  [`graph_random()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/graph_random.md).
- Users can supply titles when plotting `multigrain_graph_constraint` or
  `multigrain_graph_optimal` objects.

### Bug fixes

- Global and local graph optimiser stages now independently sample from
  the full p-value simulation matrix when a subset is requested.
- [`trial_success()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/trial_success.md)
  now accepts expressions/strings containing only `r<digit>` symbols,
  numeric literals, and operators; this fixes failures when an object
  named `r<digit>` exists in the global environment.

### Changes

- `optimise_graph()` and `optimize_graph()` have been renamed to
  [`graph_optimise()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/graph_optimise.md)
  and
  [`graph_optimize()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/graph_optimise.md)
- the `verbose` argument to
  [`graph_optimise()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/graph_optimise.md)
  and
  [`trial_success()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/trial_success.md)
  is no longer a logical, but a character with the user being able to
  choose one of three verbosity levels:
  - `"info"`: will only show milestones / informational messages
    highlighting the progress of the optimisation at coarse-grained
    level. This corresponds to what was previously `TRUE`.
  - `"detail"`: will show milestones and information about fine-grained
    optimisation events. All local and global optimisation messages are
    displayed in the console. This is a newly introduced level.
  - `"silent"`: no information about the progress of the optimisation is
    printed to the console. This corresponds to what was previously
    `FALSE`.
  - verbosity can be control both at *function-* and *package-* level.
    At *package-level* this is done with the `multigrain_verbosity`
    option which should be set to one of the three possible values
    (“detail” \> “info” \> “silent”).
- in calls to the following functions all optional arguments must be
  named (they can no longer be passed by position):
  [`calc_power_pvals()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/calc_power_pvals.md),
  [`graph_constraint()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/graph_constraint.md),
  [`graph_optimise()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/graph_optimise.md),
  [`simulate_pvalues()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/simulate_pvalues.md),
  and
  [`normalise_sum()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/normalise_sum.md).
  These functions also gain an `...` (also know as the “ellipsis”)
  argument to allow for future extensions.
- `random_graph()` has been renamed to
  [`graph_random()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/graph_random.md)
  (for consistency with
  [`graph_optimise()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/graph_optimise.md)
  and to avoid a conflict with
  [`graphicalMCP::random_graph()`](https://openpharma.github.io/graphicalMCP/reference/example_graphs.html)).
- Updates to the `multigrain_control` object’s print method:
  - `optimArgs` settings for the global optimisation are now printed,
    not just the top level class.
- Changes to the `multigrain_graph_optimal` object:
  - the `GA_output` element has been renamed to `global_output`.
  - the `nloptr_output` element has been renamed to `local_output`.
  - the `opt_settings$global_search` element is replaced by
    `global_search`.
- Changes to parallelisation:
  - `optimise_graph_parallel()` has been removed.
  - use
    [`graph_optimise()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/graph_optimise.md)
    with `num_threads` instead.
  - `control_parallel()` and the `parallel_opt` slot on
    `multigrain_control` are removed.
  - `grain_size` is no longer user-facing; it is always auto-tuned
    internally.
- `global_output` and `local_output` now store the raw global (`GA`) /
  local (`nloptr`) objects directly.
- `control_global_search()` has been removed. Reverted to
  `global_search` being a direct argument to
  [`graph_optimise()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/graph_optimise.md).
- the names of the multigrain S3 classes are now prefixed with
  \`“multigrain\_”:
  - `graph_constraint` -\> `multigrain_graph_constraint`.
  - `graph_optimal` -\> `multigrain_graph_optimal`.
  - `trial_success` -\> `multigrain_trial_success`.
  - no change for *control*, which has always been `multigrain_control`.
  - the [`summary()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/summary.html) and
    [`print()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html) methods for these
    objects have been updated.
- [`graph_optimise()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/graph_optimise.md)’s
  renormalises hypothesis-weight vectors and transition-matrix rows via
  [`normalise_sum()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/normalise_sum.md).
  Now each call will use a `tolerance` passed from `graph_constraint`.
  If not supplied, it will fall back to
  `tolerance = sqrt(.Machine$double.eps)`

## multigrain 0.2.0

### New functionality

- Advanced optimisation configuration is now handled via a new
  `multigrain_control` object and a family of `control_*()` functions.
  The main optimisation functions (`optimise_graph()`,
  `optimise_graph_parallel()`) take a single control argument, providing
  a unified and extensible API for setting optimisation parameters.
- Dedicated function to find closest graph conditional to constraints
  (`closest_graph_to_constraints()`).
- Added `optimise_graph_parallel()`, which has identical behaviour to
  `optimise_graph()` but exploits multithreaded parallel execution of
  graphical test using RcppParallel package.
  - Users can set parallelisation options (`num_threads`, `grain_size`),
    with
    [`multigrain_control()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/multigrain_control.md) +
    `control_parallel()`.
  - Default behaviour is to use a single thread.
- Both `optimise_graph()` and `optimise_graph_parallel()` now use a
  memory efficient implementation of the Bretz shortcut algorithm in the
  internal functions `graph_shortcut()` and `graph_shortcut_parallel()`.
  The full CTP is still available in `apply_ctp()` - this will be used
  for Simes and parametric graph optimisation in future releases.
- Users can supply names for unconstrained graphs via the `names`
  argument to \`graph_constraint_free().

### Bug fixes

- `$power$trial_success` from `graph_optimal` object did not match the
  graph the user sees (e.g. when plotting), due to power being
  calculated before pruning. `multigrain` now stores pre-pruned powers
  as `$global_opt_power` / `$local_opt_power`, and set `$power` to the
  post-pruned evaluation.
- Improved argument checking and error messages for optimisation
  parameters.

### Changes

- The sample size optimisation functionality (`optimise_N()`) has been
  removed.
- Improvements to print and summary methods for key S3 classes
  (`graph_optimal`, `graph_constraint`, and `trial_success`).

## multigrain 0.1.1 - 2025-10-02

### New functionality

### Bug fixes

- Fixed bug that causes 2-hypothesis optimisation of graphs using
  `optimise_graphs()` to fail.
- Fixed the behaviour of `graph_constraint_free(2)`.

### Changes

- Fixed print/summary S3 methods for `graph_optimal` to refer to “trial
  success” instead of “power objective”.

## multigrain 0.1.0 - 2025-09-20

### New functionality

- Sample size optimisation through `optimise_N()`
  - Minimises sample size, finding the optimal graph to do this with
    trial success / per-hypothesis marginal power targets.
- Added plotting methods for `graph_optimal` and `graph_constraint`
  objects.
  - Both can be plotted with
    [`autoplot()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/autoplot.html)
    and [`plot()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html)
    functions.
- Overhauled the `graph_constraint` functionality:
  - a `graph_constraint` is created with
    [`graph_constraint()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/graph_constraint.md)
  - added built-in validation
  - diagnosis is optional and can be accessed by running
    `graph_constraint(..., diagnose = TRUE)`
  - create an unconstrained graph constraint with
    [`graph_constraint_free()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/graph_constraint_free.md).
  - users can get and set `graph_constraint` elements with `[` and `$`.
    A modified `graph_constraint` is then automatically (re-)validated.
  - `graph_constraint` validation happens with tolerance
- {pkgwdown} site and vignette
- [`simulate_pvalues()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/simulate_pvalues.md)
  function simulates raw p-values from under the alternative hypotheses
  and the assumption that the distribution of test statistics is a
  multivariate normal distribution.
- Add graph validation functions

### Bug fixes

- Bug where regex translation of trial_success function does not create
  correct code.
- Internal function `recover_G()` did not recover transition matrices
  from genetic chromosome every time, this has been fixed with its
  replacement `recover_full_trans_matrix()`

### Changes

- `calc_power()` function created based on `eval_power()` (the latter is
  deleted)
- Many functions, classes and arguments have been renamed. The most
  significant are:
  - The `graphOpt` S3 class is now named the `graph_optimal`.
  - Power objectives are referred to as “trial success measures”;
    `customPowerObj()` is renamed to
    [`trial_success()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/trial_success.md)
    to reflect this.
  - Functions and function arguments have been changed to have
    snake-case convention, e.g.,
    - `graphOpt()` function is now `optimise_graph()`
    - `graphConstraint()` function is now
      [`graph_constraint()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/graph_constraint.md)
      and so on.
  - Checks of `pvals`/`graph_constraint`/`start_graph` dimensions and
    arguments have been introduced for `optimise_graph()` to prevent
    downstream crashing.

## multigrain 0.0.2 - 2024-10-21

### New functionality

- GA hybrid-global optimisation route
- Documentation for core functions
- print and summary S3 methods for `graphOpt` class
- Unit tests for all core functions
- Proprietary license
- Changed function name `designConstraint` to `graphConstraint`
- Added m=2 option for optimisation
- [`is_graph_valid()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/is_graph_valid.md)
  function to check graph validity
- [`normalise_sum()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/normalise_sum.md)
  (replaced `normalise_exactly()`) to fix floating point errors causing
  w and G-rows to not sum to 1. Now uses tolerance-based convergence and
  respects fixed-element constraints.

### Changes

- Confirmed R package dependencies (GA, nloptr, gMCPLite, and so on)
- Updated the version in the DESCRIPTION file from 0.0.1 to 0.0.2
- Removed inequality constraints from NLOPT routine

### Bug fixes

- Bug where local/global power comparison at end of `optimise_graph()`
  would not return correct graph (should be highest-power valid graph)
