# Getting Started with multigrain

## What Does **`multigrain`** Do?

The **`multigrain`** package is designed to optimise graph-based
multiple testing procedures by identifying the hypothesis and transition
weights that maximise a user-defined definition of trial success, given
an expected distribution of test statistics.

A graphical test has:

1.  An **$`m`$-length hypothesis weight vector** (*$`w`$*), which
    determines how $`\alpha`$ is initially allocated between hypotheses
    in the graph.
2.  A **transition matrix** ($`\mathbf{G}`$) of dimensions
    $`m \times m`$ which determines how $`\alpha`$ can be recycled from
    a null hypothesis after it has been rejected to other unrejected
    hypotheses.

Optimising for different power metrics or trial success criteria will
often lead to distinct graphs, i.e., distinct values for the parameters
that make up the hypothesis weight vectors ($`w`$), and the transition
matrices ($`\mathbf{G}`$).

Each trial success measure has its own optimal configuration of these
parameters that maximizes the desired success criterion. The
**`multigrain`** function
[`graph_optimise()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/graph_optimisation.md)
is the tool that identifies these optimal parameters, enabling users to
find the graph that gives that highest value for their chosen trial
success measure.

The fixed-sample gain-function optimisation framework implemented by
[`trial_success()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/trial_success.md)
and
[`graph_optimise()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/graph_optimisation.md)
is described in [Spiers et al. (2026), *Gain-function optimisation of
graphical multiple testing procedures for confirmatory clinical trials*
(arXiv:2609.19994v1)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.19994).

## Motivating Example

Consider a two-arm parallel confirmatory clinical trial to compare a
high and low dose of an investigational treatment in patients with
asthma versus placebo.

There are two endpoints included in the multiplicity adjustment:

- a primary endpoint, FEV1;
- a secondary endpoint, a patient-report outcome (PRO).

Thus there are four hypotheses, the primary hypotheses $`H_1`$ and
$`H_2`$ on FEV1 comparing high and low dose of the investigational
treatment against placebo, and the secondary hypotheses $`H_3`$ and
$`H_4`$ on the PRO endpoint for the high and low dose comparisons
against placebo.

![Figure 1: Hypotheses for asthma motivating
example](images/get-started-hypotheses-web-version.jpg)

Figure 1: Hypotheses for asthma motivating example

The secondary hypothesis for the PRO endpoint will only be tested after
the corresponding primary endpoint FEV1 has been rejected for the same
dose.

## Inputs for optimisation by **`multigrain`**

Optimisation of graphical tests is conducted using the function
[`graph_optimise()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/graph_optimisation.md)
from the **`multigrain`** package.

In order to optimise a graph-based multiple testing procedure, we
require three things:

1.  P-value matrix approximating joint distribution of p-values
2.  A trial success measure
3.  Required constraints on a graph

### P-value matrix approximating the joint distribution of p-values

[`graph_optimise()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/graph_optimisation.md)
expects a matrix $`\mathbf{P}`$ of **raw p-values** with dimension
$`n_{\text{sim}}\times m`$.

Each row $`i`$ is a simulation of p-values from the $`m`$ null
hypotheses $`H_1, H_2, ..., H_m`$ under the alternative hypothesis that
configuration you wish to evaluate.

There are two equivalent ways to provide $`\mathbf{P}`$:

1.  **Supply your own p-value matrix** (e.g., from end-to-end trial
    simulation).
2.  **Generate $`\mathbf{P}`$ with**
    [`simulate_pvalues()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/simulate_pvalues.md),
    which uses the standard normal-approximation for one-sided test
    statistics (described next).

#### From the joint test statistic distribution to p-value matrix

At the design stage it is common to assume the one-sided test statistics
are jointly normal:

``` math
\boldsymbol{Z} \sim \mathrm{MVN}(\boldsymbol{\Delta}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}),
```

where:

- $`\boldsymbol{\Delta}`$ are the *non-centrality parameters* (NCPs)
  reflecting the standardised effect sizes,
- $`\boldsymbol{\Sigma}`$ is the correlation matrix describing the
  dependence between the test statistics.

Each “raw” p-value (a p-value *unadjusted* for multiplicity) arises from
the transformation:

``` math
p_i = 1 - \operatorname{\Phi}(z_i)
```

so the p-values inherit a joint distribution determined entirely by
$`(\boldsymbol{\Delta}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma})`$.

Often you know the one-sided **nominal per-hypothesis power** (the power
of each hypothesis unadjusted for multiplicity) -
$`\pi_i = 1 - \beta_i`$ - at level $`\alpha`$, rather than the
non-centrality parameter $`\Delta_i`$. There is a one-to-one
relationship between $`\pi_i`$ and $`\Delta_i`$:

``` math
\Delta_i \;=\; \Phi^{-1}(1-\alpha)\;-\;\Phi^{-1}(1-\pi_i).
```

\[[`simulate_pvalues()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/simulate_pvalues.md)\]
performs this conversion internally, simulates
$`\boldsymbol{Z}\sim\mathrm{MVN}(\boldsymbol{\Delta},\boldsymbol{\Sigma})`$,
and returns raw p-values $`p_i=1-\Phi(Z_i)`$ to generate a matrix of
`nsim` simulations.

Important: Note on One-Sided Tests and Power Terminology

##### **One-Sided Tests** and **Power Terminology**

When designing and optimising a graph, it’s essential to use a
**one-sided testing framework**. The simulation engine in
**`multigrain`** is built on a model of one-sided test statistics,
assuming
$`z \sim \mathrm{MVN}(\boldsymbol{\Delta}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma})`$, to
correctly represent the *direction* of a treatment’s effect. For this
reason, you should specify a one-sided alpha level (e.g.,
$`\alpha = 0.025`$, which is also the default being used).

##### **Power Terminology**

Furthermore, the term for the input power vector (`power_nominal` in
[`simulate_pvalues()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/simulate_pvalues.md))
can be a point of confusion. We use the term **nominal per-hypothesis
power** to refer to the power of each hypothesis *before* any
multiplicity adjustment, as if it were tested in isolation at the full
alpha level. This is distinct from the **local power**, which is the
actual probability of rejecting a hypothesis *after* the graphical
procedure is applied.

#### Asthma example: simulating the p-value matrix using `simulate_pvalues()`

with working correlation matrix for $`(H_1,\dots,H_4)`$:

``` math
\boldsymbol{\Sigma} =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0.5 & 0.8 & 0.4 \\
0.5 & 1 & 0.4 & 0.8 \\
0.8 & 0.4 & 1 & 0.5 \\
0.4 & 0.8 & 0.5 & 1
\end{bmatrix}.
```

``` r

power_vector <- c(0.97, 0.91, 0.86, 0.83)
corr_matrix <- matrix(
  c(1, 0.5, 0.8, 0.4,
    0.5, 1, 0.4, 0.8,
    0.8, 0.4, 1, 0.5,
    0.4, 0.8, 0.5, 1),
  nrow = 4, byrow = TRUE
)

set.seed(1)
pvals <- simulate_pvalues(
    power_nominal = power_vector,
    alpha = 0.025,
    corr_matrix = corr_matrix,
    nsim = 1e6 # Increase for greater precision
)

dim(pvals) # n.sim × 4
#> [1] 1000000       4
head(pvals) # first few rows
#>              [,1]         [,2]         [,3]         [,4]

```

### Trial Success Measure

The **trial success measure** is the target quantity that
[`graph_optimise()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/graph_optimisation.md)
maximises. It encodes the success criteria for a trial by mapping the
outcomes of the graphical test to a numerical score. (A dedicated
vignette on trial success measures is planned for a future release.)

After analysing the collected data from our trial, we obtain four raw
p-values: $`p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4`$, each corresponding to one of our
hypotheses $`H_1, H_2, H_3, H_4`$.

Our output after applying our graphical test to our p-values will be a
binary rejection vector:

``` math
\boldsymbol{r} = (r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4)
```

where $`r_i = 1`$ if $`H_i`$ is rejected, and $`0`$ otherwise.

The trial success measure is then defined as the expected value of a
user-specified function of $`\boldsymbol{r}`$. In our asthma example, we
will use two different examples of trial success measures:

1.  **Average Power:** This measures the mean proportion of hypotheses
    rejected across trials:
    ``` math
    \text{Average Power} = \mathbb{E} \left[ \frac{1}{4} ( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + r_4 ) \right]
    ```

2.  **Custom Trial Success:** In our example, it seems natural to
    declare a trial successful if at least one of the two primary
    dose-control comparisons ($`H_1`$ or $`H_2`$) is statistically
    significant. Rejecting a key secondary ($`H_3`$ or $`H_4`$) would be
    ‘nice to have,’ but not essential for claiming the success of a
    trial. It also seems natural that we should not ascribe additional
    benefit for rejecting a secondary hypothesis without having first
    rejected the associated primary hypothesis for the same dose.
    Therefore we can construct the following power objective for our
    example:

    - Success for rejecting at least one of the two primary dose-control
      comparisons $`H_1`$ or $`H_2`$ (but no extra credit for rejecting
      both)
    - $`H_3`$ and $`H_4`$ only add value if their corresponding primary
      endpoints ($`H_1`$ and $`H_2`$) are also rejected.

``` math
  \text{Custom Trial Success} = \mathbb{E} \left[ \frac{1}{4} \left( 2 \times \mathbb{I}(r_1 + r_2 \geq 1) + r_1 \times   r_3 + r_2 \times r_4 \right) \right]
```
where:
``` math
  \mathbb{I}(r_1 + r_2 \geq 1) =
    \begin{cases}
    1, & \text{if } r_1 \text{ or } r_2 = 1 \\
    0, & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
```

#### Implementing trial success measures using `trial_success()`

We can create functions to quickly calculate our trial success measures
during graph optimisation by using the
[`trial_success()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/trial_success.md)
functions. This function will output a `trial_success` object, which
will contain a function we will use to calculate our custom trial
success measure during and after optimisation, allowing us to evaluate
the performance of different graphs.
[`trial_success()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/trial_success.md)
will write this function in C++ using the `Rcpp` package.

``` r

# Creating power objective functions as targets for optimisation
average_power <- trial_success(0.25 * (r1 + r2 + r3 + r4))
#> ✔ Trial success function compiled and sourced successfully.
custom_trial_success <- trial_success(
    0.25 * (2 * (r1 && r2) + r1 * r3 + r2 * r4)
)
#> ✔ Trial success function compiled and sourced successfully.
```

Multiplying our objective functions by $`0.25`$ scale our objective
functions so that they are in the interval $`[0, 1]`$, but this is not
necessary for optimisation.

### Constraints on a graph

Let us assume that we decide *a priori* to avoid testing a secondary
hypothesis for a dose-control comparison without having rejected the
associated primary hypothesis. We can ensure that the optimal graph is
found within this logical constraint by using the
[`graph_constraint()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/graph_constraint.md)
function.

``` r

# Creating a graph constraint object to enforce logical constraints
# on order of rejections

hyp_constraint <- c(NA, NA, 0, 0)
trans_constraint <- matrix(
  c(0, NA, NA, 0,
    NA, 0, 0, NA,
    0, 1, 0, 0,
    1, 0, 0, 0),
  nrow = 4,
  byrow = TRUE
)

my_constraint <- graph_constraint(
    hyp_constraint = hyp_constraint,
    trans_constraint = trans_constraint
)

print(my_constraint)
#> <multigrain_graph_constraint>
#> Constraints on hypothesis weights:
#> H1 H2 H3 H4 
#> NA NA  0  0 
#> 
#> Constraints on transition matrix:
#>    H1 H2 H3 H4
#> H1  0 NA NA  0
#> H2 NA  0  0 NA
#> H3  0  1  0  0
#> H4  1  0  0  0
```

- `NA` signifies “no constraint”, i.e., the hypothesis weight or
  transition weight can take any value within $`[0, 1]`$ (as long as the
  hypothesis weights or sum of the transition matrix rows sum to 1).
- If a weight vector or matrix element contains a number (e.g., 1), it
  means means the corresponding hypothesis or transition weight is fixed
  and will not be optimised.
- A zero as an element in the transition matrix means no (initial) edge
  is allowed between the corresponding hypotheses.
- All diagonals must be zero in the transition matrix (as alpha must be
  propagated) to other hypotheses after rejection.

The above code leads to the following general graph:

![Figure 2: Graph with constraints for “Getting Started with multigrain”
asthma example](images/get-started-graph-constraint-web-version.jpg)

Figure 2: Graph with constraints for “Getting Started with multigrain”
asthma example

Only the hypothesis weights $`w_1, w_2`$ and transition weights
$`g_{12}, g_{21}, g_{13}, g_{24}`$ will be optimised.

Although not necessary, setting constraints on a graph can speed up the
optimisation since we will have less parameters to optimise.

We can check the constraints using `plot(my_constraint)` (see below):

``` r

plot(my_constraint)
```

![](get-started_files/figure-html/graph_constraint_plot-1.png)

Please see the [dedicated
vignette](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/articles/articles/graph_constraint.md)
on this topic for more details about setting and plotting graph
constraints.

## Optimising the graph

Now we have our inputs (assumed test statistic distribution, a
`trial_success` object containing our function to quickly calculate the
trial success measure, and optional constraints on the graph), we are
ready to optimise using
[`graph_optimise()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/graph_optimisation.md).
We will optimise for our two objective functions, `average_power` and
`custom_trial_success` separately.

``` r

# Find optimal graph based on average power objective function
graph_average_power <- graph_optimise(
    pvals = pvals,
    graph_constraint = my_constraint,
    alpha = 0.025, # one-sided
    trial_success = average_power
)

# Find optimal graph based on custom power objective function (defined earlier)
graph_custom_trial_success <- graph_optimise(
    pvals = pvals,
    graph_constraint = my_constraint,
    alpha = 0.025, # one-sided
    trial_success = custom_trial_success
)
```

##### **Tuning the Optimiser for Precision vs. Speed**

The back-end of
[`graph_optimise()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/graph_optimisation.md)
executes two searches in sequence:

1.  a **global** search of the solution space using a genetic algorithm;
2.  a **local** “hill-climbing” algorithm (COBYLA) that refines the best
    region found by the global search.

All tuning is done through a
[`multigrain_control()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/multigrain_control.md)
object, which is passed to
[`graph_optimise()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/graph_optimisation.md)
via the `control` argument.

**Number of simulations**

[`control_nsim_global()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/control_nsim.md)
and
[`control_nsim_local()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/control_nsim.md)
set the number of p-value rows used to evaluate trial success during the
global and local phases respectively:

``` r

ctrl <- multigrain_control() |>
  control_nsim_global(50000) |>
  control_nsim_local(500000)
```

- We recommend **at least 50,000** simulations for the global search if
  the graph will be used in a protocol/SAP.
- The local search should use **as many simulations as possible** (at
  least 500,000). By default
  [`graph_optimise()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/graph_optimisation.md)
  uses all rows of the `pvals` matrix you provide.

**Stopping the global search**

The global search (genetic algorithm) stops after the trial success
measure fails to improve for a number of consecutive generations. This
is controlled by the `run` parameter (from
[`GA::ga()`](https://github.com/luca-scr/GA/reference/ga.html)),
accessible via
[`control_global()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/control_global.md):

``` r

ctrl <- ctrl |>
  control_global(run = 1000)
```

- The default is **200** generations, which returns a graph quickly.
- For a graph that will be used in a protocol/SAP, set `run` to at least
  **1000** to ensure a thorough search.

**Parallel execution**

For large problems with many hypotheses (m ≥ 6), enable parallel
execution via the `num_threads` argument of
[`graph_optimise()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/graph_optimisation.md):

``` r

g_opt <- graph_optimise(
  pvals = pvals,
  graph_constraint = my_constraint,
  alpha = 0.025,
  trial_success = custom_trial_success,
  num_threads = 4
)
```

**Skipping the global search**

Additionally, if you already have a good starting graph, you can skip
the global search entirely by setting `global_search` to `FALSE`:

``` r

g_opt <- graph_optimise(
  pvals = pvals,
  graph_constraint = my_constraint,
  alpha = 0.025,
  trial_success = custom_trial_success,
  global_search = FALSE,
  num_threads = 4
)
```

**Putting it together**

``` r

ctrl <- multigrain_control() |>
  control_nsim_global(50000) |>
  control_nsim_local(1e6) |>
  control_global(run = 1000)

g_opt <- graph_optimise(
  pvals = pvals,
  graph_constraint = my_constraint,
  alpha = 0.025,
  trial_success = custom_trial_success,
  num_threads = 4,
  control = ctrl
)
```

## Results

Once optimised, we can retrieve a summary from the `optimal_graph`
objects produced by
[`graph_optimise()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/graph_optimisation.md):

``` r

print(
    "Summary of the optimisation results for the graph optimised for AVERAGE power"
)
summary(graph_average_power)
```

We can plot the graph using the
[`plot()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html) function for
the `optimal_graph` objects.

``` r

p1 <- plot(graph_average_power) +
    ggtitle("Optimal Graph for Average Power") +
    theme(
        plot.title = element_text(
            hjust = 0.5,
            size = 14,
            margin = margin(0, 0, 30, 0)
        )
    )

p2 <- plot(graph_custom_trial_success) +
    ggtitle("Optimal Graph for Custom Success") +
    theme(
        plot.title = element_text(
            hjust = 0.5,
            size = 14,
            margin = margin(0, 0, 30, 0)
        )
    )

gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)
```

## Evaluating Trial Success

We can evaluate the power / trial success of each graph by using the
[`calc_power_pvals()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/calc_power_pvals.md)
function.

``` r

# Calculate power for graph optimised for average power
graph_avg_power_metrics <- calc_power_pvals(
    pvals,
    alpha = 0.025,
    hyp_weight = graph_average_power$hyp_weight,
    trans_matrix = graph_average_power$trans_matrix,
    custom_power = list("CustomSuccess" = custom_trial_success)
)

# Expected Rejections / 4 is equal to average power

    hyp_weight = graph_custom_trial_success$hyp_weight,
    trans_matrix = graph_custom_trial_success$trans_matrix,

In the table above:

- Columns `H1` - `H4` show the *local* power of each hypothesis under
  the graph and the assumed test statistic distribution,
- `Average Power` and `Custom Success` show the value of the objective
  functions defined in the section on [trial success
  measures](#trial-success-measure).
