# multigrain

## Overview

**multigrain** (**Mul**tiple **T**esting using **Gr**aphical
**A**pproaches; **I**mprove power with **N**umerical Optimisation) is an
R package that finds the optimal graphical multiple testing procedure
for your clinical trial.

Confirmatory trials routinely test multiple hypotheses — across
endpoints, doses, or subpopulations — and must strongly control the
family-wise error rate (FWER). [Graphical
approaches](https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.3495) are a popular framework
for this, but choosing the hypothesis weights and transition matrix that
make up the graph is typically done by hand.

**multigrain** automates this: given simulated p-values and a
user-defined **trial success measure** (a function that scores each
possible pattern of hypothesis rejections), it searches over hypothesis
weights and transition weights to find the graph that maximises expected
trial success. The result is a valid graphical test that strongly
controls FWER.

The fixed-sample gain-function optimisation workflow implemented by
[`trial_success()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/trial_success.md)
and
[`graph_optimise()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/graph_optimise.md)
is described in [Spiers et al. (2026), *Gain-function optimisation of
graphical multiple testing procedures for confirmatory clinical trials*
(arXiv:2609.19994v1)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.19994).

## Installation

**multigrain** is not on CRAN yet. Install the development version from
GitHub with:

``` r

# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("GSK-Biostatistics/multigrain")
```

## Quick start

Below is an end-to-end example with four hypotheses: two primary (H1,
H2) and two secondary (H3, H4). Secondaries are gated by their
corresponding primaries (H3 can only be tested after H1 is rejected; H4
after H2).

### 1. Simulate p-values

Assume one-sided test statistics are jointly normal. Provide the
per-hypothesis nominal power (unadjusted for multiplicity) and a
correlation matrix:

``` r

library(multigrain)

power_nominal <- c(0.95, 0.90, 0.85, 0.80)
corr_mat <- matrix(
    c(
        1.0, 0.5, 0.4, 0.2,
        0.5, 1.0, 0.2, 0.4,
        0.4, 0.2, 1.0, 0.5,
        0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 1.0
    ),
    nrow = 4, byrow = TRUE
)

set.seed(1)
pvals <- simulate_pvalues(
    power_nominal = power_nominal,
    corr_matrix = corr_mat,
    nsim = 1e5
)
```

### 2. Define trial success measures

Use
[`trial_success()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/trial_success.md)
to express what “success” means for the trial. The variables
`r1, r2, r3, r4` are binary indicators — `ri = 1` if hypothesis Hi is
rejected, 0 otherwise. You can combine them with arithmetic (`+`, `*`)
and logical (`&&`, `||`) operators.

``` r

# Average power: mean proportion of hypotheses rejected
avg_power <- trial_success(0.25 * (r1 + r2 + r3 + r4))

# Disjunctive power: at least one rejection
disjunctive <- trial_success(r1 || r2 || r3 || r4)

# Custom: require a primary rejection, with extra credit for the
# gated secondary (H3 adds value only if H1 is also rejected, etc.)
custom_success <- trial_success(
    0.25 * (2 * (r1 || r2) + r1 * r3 + r2 * r4)
)
```

### 3. Constrain the graph (optional)

Use
[`graph_constraint()`](https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/multigrain/dev/reference/graph_constraint.md)
to encode structural rules — for example, that only primaries receive
initial alpha, and that secondaries can only receive alpha recycled from
their gating primary:

``` r

gc <- graph_constraint(
    hyp_constraint  = c(NA, NA, 0, 0),
    trans_constraint = matrix(
        c(
            0, NA, NA, 0,
            NA, 0, 0, NA,
            0, 1, 0, 0,
            1, 0, 0, 0
        ),
        nrow = 4, byrow = TRUE
    )
)
```

Here `NA` means “free to optimise” and a fixed number means “held
constant”.

### 4. Optimise

``` r

g_opt <- graph_optimise(
    pvals = pvals,
    trial_success = custom_success,
    graph_constraint = gc
)

summary(g_opt)
plot(g_opt)
```

### 5. Evaluate

Compute multiplicity-adjusted power and any custom trial success
measures for the optimised graph:

``` r

calc_power_pvals(
    pvals,
    hyp_weight   = g_opt$hyp_weight,
    trans_matrix = g_opt$trans_matrix,
    custom_power = list(
        AvgPower      = avg_power,
        Disjunctive   = disjunctive,
        CustomSuccess = custom_success
    )
)
```
